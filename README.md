## Key features

**Search with filters** — Search by keyword and location.

**Incremental mode** — Only get new or changed listings since your last run. Content hash per listing — no duplicates, no re-processing.

**Change classification** — Track unchanged, expired across runs. Build audit trails of how listings evolve over time.

**Compact output** — Emit core fields only (AI-agent / MCP-friendly). Keeps response size small for LLM workflows.

**Result cap** — Stop after N listings. Set to 0 for the full catalog.

**Export anywhere** — Download as JSON, CSV, or Excel. Stream via Apify API, webhooks, or integrations with Make, Zapier, Airbyte, Keboola.

**Structured data** — Every listing returns the same schema with consistent field naming. All fields always present — `null` when unavailable, never omitted.

## Use cases

**B2B lead generation in Austria**
Build targeted prospect lists of Austrian companies by industry (`Steuerberater`, `IT-Dienstleistungen`, `Rechtsanwalt`, `Bäckerei`…) and federal state. Each record includes phone, email, website, VAT ID, and street address — ready for CRM import.

**Firmenbuch / compliance enrichment**
Pull Firmenbuchnummer, Rechtsform, board members, and the latest Jahresabschluss balance sheet (total assets, equity, net income, liabilities) for due-diligence, KYC, and credit-risk workflows without scraping the Firmenbuch register directly.

**Market & competitive intelligence**
Snapshot an entire vertical across all 9 Austrian Bundesländer. Combine with incremental runs to detect new market entrants, name/address changes, or companies that disappear from the directory.

**Data pipeline automation**
Integrate with ETL on a schedule — JSON, CSV, Excel, or streamed via the Apify API, webhooks, Make, Zapier, Airbyte, Keboola. Incremental mode keeps recurring runs cheap by emitting only new or changed records.

**AI / LLM training data**
Structured JSON per company is ready for RAG pipelines, embeddings, and agent workflows. Compact mode trims the schema to core contact+identity fields to fit LLM context windows.

## Input parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | — | Keyword to search for (e.g. "Bäckerei", "IT-Dienstleistungen", "Steuerberater"). Combine with location to narrow results. |
| `location` | string | — | Austrian federal state or city to filter by (e.g. "Wien", "Oberösterreich", "Graz"). Leave empty to search all of Austria. |
| `startUrls` | array | — | Optional: provide specific FirmenABC company detail URLs to scrape directly (e.g. https://www.firmenabc.at/wien-holding-gmbh_ocT). Ignored if query is set. |
| `maxResults` | integer | `100` | Maximum number of companies to return. 0 = no limit. Use a small number for testing. |
| `compact` | boolean | `false` | Return only core fields (name, url, address, telephone, vatId, rechtsform, changeType). Ideal for AI-agent and MCP workflows to reduce token usage. |
| `incrementalMode` | boolean | `false` | Only emit companies that are new or have changed since the last run. Requires stateKey. Saves cost on repeated runs. |
| `stateKey` | string | — | Unique identifier for this tracking session (e.g. "at-all-companies"). Required when incrementalMode is true. |
| `emitUnchanged` | boolean | `false` | When incremental mode is on, also emit companies with no detected changes (changeType=UNCHANGED). |
| `emitExpired` | boolean | `false` | When incremental mode is on, also emit companies that disappeared since the last run (changeType=EXPIRED). |

## FAQ

**How much does it cost?**
Pay-per-event pricing — you only pay for listings extracted. Apify's free $5 credit is enough to run thousands of results before you pay anything.

**How does incremental mode work?**
Each listing gets a content hash. On subsequent runs, only new or changed listings are emitted — saving time, compute, and storage. Expired listings can be tracked separately.

**Do I need an API key or credentials?**
No. Just sign up for Apify, paste your input, and click Start. No credit card required.
